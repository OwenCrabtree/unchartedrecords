			 <button onclick="showMore2()" id="button2">+</button>When did you start?
			 </h3>
			 <p id="faq2" style="display:none">
			  We started in late 2016. Founded by the great Owen Crabtree. We started off with one Artist but are currently working to get more.

			 <h3>
			 <button onclick="showMore3()" id="button3">+</button>Do you accept demo tapes?
			 </h3>
			 <p id="faq3" style="display:none">
			  Yes, we accept demo tapes, but they must contain at least 3 songs and be sent in by CD. To find out the address to send them to, you 
			  can send us a message through our contact page and we will get back to you with the address. This is to ensure we are not flooded with demos
			  all at once.
