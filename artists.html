		 <h2>The Artists</h2>
		 
		 <h4>The Crabtree's</h4>
		 
		 <p>
		 The Crabtree's are an Irish rock band from Dublin, Ireland. They were formed in 2016 and have been playing and recording across Dublin for the
		 last few months. Their music has been described as a cross between Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana and Queens Of the Stone Age. Their live shows
		 have been receiving critical acclaim and has been named "the best show I've seen in my life" by Steve the bartender.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 They are finishing up work on their debut album and hope to release next summer. Whenever they have a release date annouced we will put
		 a sample of the first single here so you can check it out and hear how fantastic they are for yourself.
